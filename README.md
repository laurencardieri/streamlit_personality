## Project Overview 

This project develops a machine learning algorithm to predict if someone is an extrovert or introvert based on key personal features.


The features are based on the following questions: 
- How many hours do you spend alone daily?
- Do you feel drained after socializing?
- Do you have stage fright?
- How many close friends do you have?
- How often do you go to social events?
- How frequently do you post on social media
- How frequently do you go outside?

The goal of this model is to provide individuals with insights into their own personality. This model also allows users to upload their own data, decipher who on their teams are extroverts and introverts, and make equally divided teams with roles. 

The model uses Logistic Regression.
